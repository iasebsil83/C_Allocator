This program is a bare metal library that allows you to allocate and free memory
dynamically on linux systems, the same way as malloc/free does in standard C
libraries.

Of course, as it is the main goal of this library, this implementation is
completely independant from any C library related resources and stands only by
using linux syscalls.

Demonstration program is made in src/prog.c.

More information about this library are available in src/lib/allocator.c.
